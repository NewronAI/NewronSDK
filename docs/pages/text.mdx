We  can  use  the  following  command  to  generate  the  documentation  of  the  project:

```bash
$  docgen  -i  docs  -o  docs  -t  docs  -s  docs
```

The  above  command  will  generate  the  documentation  of  the  project  in  the  docs  directory.

And thus, we have a simple documentation generator. It is not perfect, but it is a good start. We can improve it by adding more features, such as:

-  Support  for  other  languages  (such  as  Python,  JavaScript,  etc.)
- Support  for  other  formats  (such  as  HTML,  PDF,  etc.)
- Support  for  other  features  (such  as  code  highlighting,  etc.)

We can also add more features to the documentation generator, such as:
